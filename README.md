# Nuxeo Crowdin Integration

This module holds helper bash and python scripts to handle
synchronization of translation files from/to Crowdin.

The python scripts are useful to aggregate and split contributions (as
the en_US and fr_FR translation files are split accross different
Nuxeo bundles).

The bash scripts are useful to call python scripts (and other helpers)
that will:
- push changes from Crowdin to Nuxeo
- push changes from Nuxeo to Crowdin
